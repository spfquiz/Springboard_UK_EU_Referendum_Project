# Springboard_UK_EU_Referendum_Project
Analysis of the UK 2016 EU Referendum

Please look at the markdown files "UK Referendum Full Project markdown" for the R markdown script and the html output of the project.

A presentation summary will shortly be added called "UK Referendum Summary".

The source datasets have been uploaded in full except "house_prices.csv" and "National_Statistics_Postcode_Lookup_UK.csv" which are both too big to be uploaded here.

Therefore for these I have uploaded the cleaned files "house_price_clean.csv" and "postcode_lookup.csv", "postcode_lookup1.csv" & "postcode_lookup2.csv" and a limited line version of the original file so that the structure can be seen.
