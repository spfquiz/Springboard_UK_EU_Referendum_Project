##  In 2016 the UK held a referendum as to whether they should Leave the EU or Remain in it.  In line with the current wave of
##  Populism in European politics the overall result was to "Leave" by 51.9% to 48.1% "Remain".  There was a strong regional aspect to
##  the result with both Scotland and Northern Ireland strongly against leaving, but this regional bias isn't apparent for England
##  and Wales.

##  At this time the UK parliament are still struggling to agree on the implementation of the referendum and the exit date has
##  recently been put back.

##  Is it possible to build a reasonably accurate predictive model for the Leave vote?  Are there links to: EU Funding; to wealth;
##  to education; to political allegiances; to age, to EU immigration; to economic activity; to foreign travel?

##  My proposal it to create a database of socio-economic data and results from the EU Referendum by geography for England and Wales
##  only and use it to address these questions and more. 








##  As a British national living in another EU country since 2001, I have a vested interest in the impact of the referendum but was, 
##  unfortunately, not allowed to vote (having been non-resident in the UK for more than 15 years).  Therefore I will need to be 
##  particularly careful of bias.
